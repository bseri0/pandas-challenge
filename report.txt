When comparing the charter schools vs public district schools, the performance of math, readong, and percent passing for each individually and overall are substantially higher in the charter schools.
When comparing school performance by size, the small and medium sized schools measure up very closely in performance. However, the large schools do not perform quite as well in math/reading scores and overall percent passing.
